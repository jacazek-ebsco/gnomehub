## Installation

You can install GnomeHub directly from its page on [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1263/gnomehub/).

## Testing

Tests are written in [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io). To run them, you need
[jasmine-gjs](https://github.com/ptomato/jasmine-gjs), a special runner of Jasmine designed for GJS.
You can install it by [compiling it](https://github.com/ptomato/jasmine-gjs/#installation) or
by downloading a [pre-compiled package](https://software.opensuse.org/package/jasmine-gjs) for your OS.

Once installed, you can run the tests:

```bash
$ cd gnomehub
$ jasmine
```

## Debugging

Print messages with `log()` or `print()` and see them in:

```
journalctl -f /usr/bin/gnome-session
```

## Translation

To update the translation template file `locale/gnomehub.pot` run:

```
make potfile
```

To add a new language, simply copy the template and place it at the correct location, e.g. with the following commands (replacing `<ll>` by your language code):

```
mkdir -p locale/<ll>/LC_MESSAGES
cp locale/gnomehub.pot locale/<ll>/LC_MESSAGES/gnomehub.po
```
